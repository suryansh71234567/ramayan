In **Sarga 1**, Hanuman encounters Simhika, a demoness who can assume any form at her will. Despite being caught off guard, Hanuman uses his quick thinking and agility to outsmart Simhika, eventually killing her by tearing apart her vital parts with his sharp nails.\n\nWith Simhika defeated, Hanuman continues on his quest, soaring through the sky like Garuda, overcoming various challenges along the way. Throughout **Sargas 2-5**, Hanuman encounters a series of trials, including a confrontation with the sea god Varuna and a grueling journey across the ocean. Despite these hurdles, Hanuman perseveres, fueled by his determination to rescue Sita.\n\nAs he approaches Lanka, Hanuman faces yet another challenge in the form of Simhika's sister, who attempts to thwart his mission. However, Hanuman remains undaunted, using his cunning and physical prowess to overcome this obstacle as well.\n\nUltimately, Hanuman's unwavering dedication to his goal allows him to successfully complete his journey and reach Lanka, setting the stage for the epic battle between good and evil that will unfold in the subsequent cantos.",
