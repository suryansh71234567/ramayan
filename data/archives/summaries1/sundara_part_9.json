However, he recalled Brahma's boon and realized that his movement was arrested by the power of Brahma. Recognizing that he was caught in a divine trap, Hanuman decided to abide by the ordinance of Brahma and remain silent. Despite being bound by bark ropes by the ogres, Hanuman remained still, awaiting the demon king Ravana's arrival. Meanwhile, Indrajit realized that the Brahmastra did not tolerate another ordinary bondage, causing Hanuman to be released from its hold. As the scene unfolded, Hanuman found himself presented to Ravana, who was eager to interrogate him about his identity and purpose.",
